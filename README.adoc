*Stateful Context Tracking Engine for AI Conversation Continuity*

== Overview

STATE is a checkpoint/restore system for AI conversations that persists project
context, decisions, and next actions across multiple Claude conversations.

=== Problem

* Each new Claude conversation starts with zero context about ongoing projects
* Complex project interdependencies get lost between sessions
* Progress gets reset; decisions already made must be repeated
* Token limits force mid-project context loss

=== Solution

* Single declarative file (`STATE.scm`) in Guile Scheme
* Human-readable format (not JSON/binary)
* Download at end of session -> Upload at start of next
* Claude reads it and resumes exactly where you left off
* Includes: current project focus, blockers, next actions, completion percentages

== Technology Stack

*Language:* Guile Scheme (GNU's Scheme implementation)

* Minimal, readable, homoiconic (code = data)
* minikanren-like patterns for constraint/logic queries over project state

*Format:* `STATE.scm` file

== Quick Start

=== End of Conversation

----
User: "Create STATE handover and prepare for next session"
Claude:
  1. Updates all project completion percentages
  2. Lists critical blockers
  3. Exports STATE.scm
  4. Says: "Download STATE.scm now - you'll upload it next session"
----

=== Start of Next Conversation

----
User: [Uploads STATE.scm] "Continue from this state"
Claude:
  1. Reads and parses STATE.scm
  2. Reconstructs project context
  3. Identifies current focus
  4. Picks up exactly where last conversation left off
----

== File Structure

The STATE.scm file contains these major sections:

[[metadata]]
=== Metadata
Format version and timestamps for tracking state evolution.

[[user]]
=== User Context
Name, roles, language preferences, tool preferences, and values.

[[session]]
=== Session Context
Conversation ID, message counts, and token limit status.

[[focus]]
=== Focus
Current project, phase, deadlines, and blocking dependencies.

[[projects]]
=== Project Catalog
Complete list of all projects with:

* Status (in-progress, blocked, paused, complete, abandoned)
* Completion percentage
* Category and phase
* Dependencies and blockers
* Next actions

[[critical-next]]
=== Critical Next Actions
Prioritized list of immediate actions with optional deadlines.

== Query System

STATE supports minikanren-style relational queries:

[source,scheme]
----
;; What's my current focus?
(query-focus state)
;; -> "Oblibeny parser implementation"

;; What projects are blocked?
(query-blocked-projects state)
;; -> (("My Language Solo" . "blocks on Oblibeny parser"))

;; What's due this week?
(query-by-deadline state (current-week))
;; -> (("NeuroPhone" . "2025-12-13"))
----

== Why Scheme?

. *Minimal syntax* - S-expressions are almost self-explanatory
. *Lisp tradition* - Code-as-data matches logic programming
. *Portable* - Runs on Linux, macOS, Windows (via WSL)
. *GNU standard* - Free Software Foundation standard for extensibility
. *Human-readable* - Easier to read and edit than JSON

Comparison:

[source,scheme]
----
;; Scheme: minimal syntax, obvious structure
(project-name . "VALUE")

;; JSON: noise-heavy
{"projectName": "VALUE"}
----

== Roadmap

=== Phase 1: Current Implementation ✓

* [x] Basic STATE.scm structure
* [x] Project metadata encoding
* [x] Session checkpoint
* [x] Manual download/upload cycle

=== Phase 2: Smart Queries

* [ ] Implement minikanren predicates for blocking relationships
* [ ] Auto-generate dependency graphs
* [ ] Calculate "critical path" (longest chain of dependencies)
* [ ] Estimate time-to-completion

=== Phase 3: Automation

* [ ] Elixir service for STATE.scm read/write
* [ ] Integration with Echomesh for automatic state capture
* [ ] Periodic exports
* [ ] Diff tracking

=== Phase 4: Full Integration

* [ ] UPM (Universal Project Manager) integration
* [ ] Git hooks for auto-update on commits
* [ ] Team collaboration features
